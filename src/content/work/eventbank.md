Solo developer for 2 years, and work as a team member for one. On daily basis, I collaborate with product/design/backend/web teams to improve our products. The experience of working with different teams, even team member from different time zone certified my communication skill. 
I was self-managed, cooperate with marketing/product to determine develop timeline, and make sure our apps deliver on time.
The learning experiences on develop skill/business logic/communication skills are truly invalable.
