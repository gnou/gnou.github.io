Being a native app developer, we constantly need to fight the urge to add one more frameworks/libraries - They are so useful, one pertinent library can save us days of works. But they'll bloat the code base and app size, introduce dependencies you might regret few months/years later. So we want to be careful, making sure the GitHub repo we have in mind is well maintained and likely to live for a long time.

Not being a web developer and browse hacker news a lot makes me consider all web frameworks baddies, "you don't need React, just use simple HTML + JavaScript + css, you site will be much faster, you'll be better off in long run", "pure css can do so much more these days, why do you need 3rd party framework, anything Tailwind offers can be easily done in pure css".

That's the case until one start to work on any web project, it turns out frameworks/libraries for app development and web development have the same effect: we can go so much faster & easilier with them, but bad for size of code base or app bundle. Dependencies long run might fret you.

But I was wrong, plain HTML + JavaScript + css is not better than frameworks/libraries.
